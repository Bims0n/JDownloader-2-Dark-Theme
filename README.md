First off, I just wanna say THANK YOU all! I never expected the appreciation this little project of mine has gotten. Seeing so many enjoy it and express thanks for it, it's been awesome and very unexpected. That said, however....
...Because things happening in my life (and a subsecvent loss of interest in the project), I am looking for someone to take over and improve further on my theme. My focus and energy is needed elsewhere, thats sadly how IRL works :/  That's why I've been and mostly is inactive on Github. So if someone wants to get their hands dirty with this theme, go right ahead. I just ask that a link to this github and credits are given. Thats all for now folks

# JDownloader 2 Dark Theme
After seeing so many requests for a dark theme, I configured my own. 
It uses the "Black Eye" UserInterfaceSetting and a matching colorscheme I configured for the rest of the window.

I have not found anywhere it looks strange or where you cant read the text. **Edit The Menu Customizer has some troubles with text in selected fields not being readable...

I hope someone finds good use for it :)

## Installing

### Dark theme
This method will keep your current settings and add dark theme ontop
(SOOO many thanks to [Georgeto](https://github.com/Georgeto) for this alternative method! Awesome work man!)
1. Go to `Settings -> Settings` and select the `Advanced Settings` category from the list on the left.
2. Enter `LookAndFeelTheme` into the search field.
3. Only the setting `GraphicalUserInterfaceSettings: Look and Feel Theme` should remain. Set its value to `BLACK_EYE`.
4. Go to `File -> Backup -> Backup all settings` and make a backup of your JDownloader settings.
5. Make a copy of the backup, because we are going to modify it in the next step.
6. Open the backup with the zip archiver of your choice (e.g. [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)).
7. Copy the content of the [config](config/) folder into the opened backup. If asked, confirm overwriting exisiting files. ([laf](https://github.com/Vinylwalk3r/JDownloader-2-Dark-Theme/tree/master/config/cfg/laf) is the dark theme, [menus_v2](https://github.com/Vinylwalk3r/JDownloader-2-Dark-Theme/tree/master/config/cfg/menus_v2) are the toolbars, [images](https://github.com/Vinylwalk3r/JDownloader-2-Dark-Theme/tree/master/config/themes/standard/org/jdownloader/images/) are the white icons) 
8. Save the modified backup, if your archiver does not to that automatically.
9. Go to `File -> Backup -> Restore Settings` and choose the modified backup.
10. JD2 will restart now.

Now you got a Dark theme for JD2!

### Custom Themes
If you want a custom theme (our edited BlackEye for example)
1. Go to `pathtoyourjdownloaderinstall\libs\laf`
2. In this example, we rename `syntheticaBlackEye.jar` to `syntheticaBlackEye.jar.bak` (you could edit any theme you want, but you have to use the exact name of the theme you replace. This time, I edited the Blackeye)
3. Paste our edited [syntheticaBlackEye.jar](https://github.com/Vinylwalk3r/JDownloader-2-Dark-Theme/tree/master/syntheticaBlackEye.jar) here or make a copy of our backup and edit it to your liking. Just remeber to remove the .bak extension from your edited copy!
4. Restart JD2

Strange thing I found, if I pasted a new theme.jar file here, with its own name, JD2 could not find it in its list of themes. Anybody know where the file containing the theme list is?

To get the top bar to show up with the dark theme, you'll also need to run this in terminal: 
``defaults write org.jdownloader.launcher NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance 0``
