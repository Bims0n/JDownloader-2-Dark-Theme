To make custom progressbars, follow the steps below:

1. Go to `pathtoyourjdownloaderinstall\libs\laf`
2. Make a copy of `syntheticaBlackEye.jar` and paste in the same directory
3. In this example, we rename `syntheticaBlackEye.jar` to `syntheticaBlackEye.jar.bak` (you could edit any theme you want, but you have to use the exact name of the theme you replace. This time, I edited the Blackeye)
4. Download and edit the [progressbar images](https://github.com/Vinylwalk3r/JDownloader-2-Dark-Theme/tree/master/themeNameHere.jar/de/javasoft/plaf/synthetica/blackeye/images/(progressbar))  to your liking. (If you want an animation, edit them individually, each image is one frame of the animation. If you only want a solid color or still image, just edit one image and then make copies and rename them accordingly so JD2 can show them)
5. Now open our .jar file with a program like WinRAR or 7Zip. NOT THE BACKUP ONE!!!
6. Navigate in the file to `/de/javasoft/plaf/synthetica/blackeye/images/`
7. Paste our edited progressbar images here. Overwrite the once already there.
8. Close WinRAR and restart JD2

Your Done! Well done, have a cookie ^^
